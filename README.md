# Jerry Gamblin - Security Researcher & Open-Source Toolsmith

## üöÄ Founder | rogolabs.net

I am the Founder of [RogoLabs](https://rogolabs.net), an open-source security
intelligence lab dedicated to providing **Vulnerability Insights That Matter**.

My mission is to transform overwhelming vulnerability data into clear, actionable
intelligence, making security practical for everyone. RogoLabs tackles the
fundamental problem: "How do we fix what matters?" by relentlessly questioning
vulnerability data.

## üí° Core Expertise & Research Focus

* **Vulnerability Intelligence:** Building practical, open-source tools to help
  security teams cut through CVE noise and alert fatigue.
* **Offensive Security Research:** Specializing in **Automotive and Hardware
  Hacking**.
* **Tooling & Automation:** Prototyping and developing robust solutions to
  enhance **Corporate and Cloud Security** postures, primarily leveraging
  **Python**.
* **Thought Leadership:** I deliver data-driven presentations on the
  vulnerability disclosure landscape, including my talk "CVE Crisis" presented
  at DEF CON 33's AppSec Village.

## üåê My Security & Intelligence Tools (RogoLabs Projects)

These open-source projects are central to my mission of providing clarity in
vulnerability management:

* **CVE.ICU:** A real-time dashboard updated every 4 hours from the NVD,
  transforming vulnerability chaos into visual intelligence with interactive
  charts that reveal patterns and emerging trends.
* **PatchThis.app:** A vulnerability prioritization intelligence platform that
  integrates trusted sources like **CISA KEV** and **EPSS Scoring** to deliver
  a curated, actionable list of vulnerabilities. (A RogoLabs project).
* **CVEForecast.org:** An automated platform using advanced time series
  forecasting models to predict Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs),
  providing data-driven insights into future disclosure trends.
* **CNAScorecard.org:** A tool ranking CVE issuers by data completeness,
  revealing major gaps in patch information and software identifiers across
  thousands of vulnerabilities.
